# Red Wine Exploration
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of red wine data set with R for the EDA section of the Data Analyst Nanodegree on Udacity. The course that built up to this project is available for free here: https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651 

Follows the structure of Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis with a summary of findings or points or interest at the end of each section. There's then a final plots and conclusion section with 3 of the plots from the analysis polished up to look more presentable.
